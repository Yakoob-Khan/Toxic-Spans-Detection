This is called Cultural Racism.\"\n\nWell then I guess that makes me a \"cultural racist\" lol.  Simply put, I think protesters, in general, are stupid.  I know there are exceptions and outliers, but broadly speaking this is mostly true.  The issue usually doesn't matter.  You can have a handful of smart people within a protest but the bulk of the crowd is going to be irrational and stupid.  \n\nThen it becomes a question of \"why do I have to respect the views of stupid people?\"  You would never tell me to respect the views of the KKK.  Nobody would ever tell me I couldn't make fun of them.  But why is it okay for me to make fun of some stupid protesters but not others?  What kind of standard are we using here?\n\nHawaiian culture isn't opposed to telescopes.  You're just making things up about Hawaiian culture.
